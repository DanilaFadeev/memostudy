### Server-side and Frotend
You have two ways of learning memo cards. 

The first one is working with data which hosted on server in MySQL database. All manipulations come through API made with Laravel. For that you have to register the new user and log in.

The second way gives you the possibility to store all your data in LocalStorage of your browser. Be care becouse your data doesn't save at the clouds.
